# AI Difficulty System

The NPZR Game Engine features three distinct AI difficulty levels that fundamentally change how your computer opponent plays the game. Each difficulty represents a different AI personality with unique strategic approaches, decision-making patterns, and skill levels.

## Difficulty Levels

### Easy (ðŸ˜Š)
The Easy AI is designed to be approachable for new players or those wanting a more relaxed gaming experience. This AI makes frequent strategic mistakes and plays in a straightforward manner without complex planning.

**Strategic Behavior:**
- **Wild Card Usage**: Uses wild cards immediately and freely without saving them for better opportunities
- **Disruption Strategy**: Rarely attempts to disrupt your progress, focusing mainly on building its own stacks
- **Mistake Rate**: Makes poor strategic choices about 20% of the time
- **Move Complexity**: Avoids complex multi-step moves, preferring simple single-card plays

The Easy AI will occasionally help you complete stacks by accident and generally provides a gentle introduction to the game's strategic elements.

### Medium (ðŸŽ¯)
The Medium AI offers a balanced challenge suitable for players who understand the basic mechanics and want to improve their strategic thinking. This AI demonstrates good tactical awareness while still making occasional errors.

**Strategic Behavior:**
- **Wild Card Usage**: Conserves wild cards 60% of the time, saving them for more valuable opportunities
- **Disruption Strategy**: Actively looks for disruption opportunities about half the time
- **Mistake Rate**: Makes suboptimal choices about 10% of the time
- **Move Complexity**: Uses advanced moves like cascades to create powerful combinations

The Medium AI will provide genuine competition while still being beatable with good strategy and planning.

### Hard (ðŸ”¥)
The Hard AI represents an expert-level opponent that plays with near-optimal strategy and minimal errors. This difficulty is designed for experienced players seeking a serious challenge.

**Strategic Behavior:**
- **Wild Card Usage**: Carefully conserves wild cards 90% of the time, using them only when they provide maximum strategic value
- **Disruption Strategy**: Aggressively seeks disruption opportunities 80% of the time, actively working to prevent your victories
- **Mistake Rate**: Makes poor choices only 2% of the time, playing nearly perfectly
- **Move Complexity**: Masters complex cascade sequences and multi-step combinations

The Hard AI will exploit every weakness in your strategy and requires careful planning and tactical awareness to defeat.

## What This Means for Your Game

**Choosing Easy** means you'll face an opponent that's learning the game alongside you. Expect to win more often while you develop your strategic skills.

**Choosing Medium** provides a fair contest where both good strategy and tactical execution matter. Games will be competitive with either player capable of winning.

**Choosing Hard** creates an intense strategic battle where every move counts. You'll need to master advanced techniques and maintain near-perfect play to succeed.

## Visual Indicators

During gameplay, you'll see difficulty indicators in the AI's decision messages:
- ðŸ˜Š indicates Easy AI actions
- ðŸŽ¯ indicates Medium AI actions  
- ðŸ”¥ indicates Hard AI actions

These help you understand when the AI is making characteristic moves based on its difficulty level.

## Adaptive Learning Experience

The difficulty system is designed to grow with your skills. Start with Easy to learn the fundamentals, progress to Medium as you master basic strategy, and challenge Hard when you're ready for expert-level competition. Each difficulty teaches different aspects of advanced play while maintaining the core strategic depth that makes NPZR engaging at every level.
