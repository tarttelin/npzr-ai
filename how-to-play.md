## Detailed Turn Rules

### 1. Draw Phase
- **Always draw exactly 1 card** from the deck to start your turn
- If the deck is empty, shuffle all scored characters back into a new deck

### 2. Card Play Phase (Sequential)
- **Play exactly 1 card** from your hand
- **Choose target**: Either create a new stack OR add to an existing stack
- **Immediate resolution**: Check for stack completion right away

#### Stack Completion
A stack is **complete** when it has matching head, torso, and legs of the same character:
- All three cards must represent the same character (considering wild card nominations)
- **Immediate scoring**: Remove the completed stack and add the character to your score
- **Earn 1 move**: Every completion gives you exactly one move to use

### 3. Move Phase (If Earned)
If you completed a stack, you **immediately earn 1 move**:
- **Move any single card** from any stack to any other position
- **Chain reactions**: Moving a card might complete another stack
- **Cascading moves**: New completions earn additional moves
- **No limit**: Chain reactions can continue indefinitely

### 4. Wild Card Continuation
- **If your last played card was a Wild Card**: You may play another card (go back to step 2)
- **If your last played card was Regular**: Your turn ends after resolving any moves
- **Wild card chains**: You can play multiple wild cards in sequence to extend your turn

## Card Placement Rules

### Where You Can Play Cards
- **New Stack**: Create a new stack anywhere on the table
- **Your Stacks**: Add to any of your existing stacks
- **Opponent's Stacks**: Add to your opponent's stacks (defensive play!)

### Stack Organization
- Each stack has **3 piles**: Head, Torso, Legs
- Cards are placed on top of existing cards in each pile
- Only the **top card** of each pile counts for completion

## Wild Card Rules

### Nomination System
- **When played**: Wild cards must be nominated (declare what they represent)
- **Example**: "This Universal Wild is now a Ninja Head"
- **When moved**: Wild cards lose their nomination and become wild again
- **Re-nomination**: Can be nominated differently when played again

### Wild Card Types
1. **Character Wilds** (4 cards): Can be any body part for their specific character
   - Ninja Wild ‚Üí any Ninja body part
   - Pirate Wild ‚Üí any Pirate body part
   - Zombie Wild ‚Üí any Zombie body part  
   - Robot Wild ‚Üí any Robot body part

2. **Position Wilds** (3 cards): Can be any character for their specific body part
   - Head Wild ‚Üí any character's head
   - Torso Wild ‚Üí any character's torso
   - Legs Wild ‚Üí any character's legs

3. **Universal Wild** (1 card): Can be any character and any body part
   - Most powerful and flexible card in the game

## Strategic Elements

### Offensive Strategy
- **Build efficiently**: Focus on completing characters you're closest to finishing
- **Wild card timing**: Use wild cards to extend turns and create big combo plays
- **Move optimization**: Use earned moves to set up future completions

### Defensive Strategy
- **Block opponents**: Play cards on their stacks to prevent completion
- **Resource denial**: Take wild cards they need for their builds
- **Timing disruption**: Force them to complete less valuable characters first

### Advanced Tactics
- **Cascade planning**: Set up multiple stacks to create chain reaction opportunities
- **Wild card conservation**: Save powerful wilds for game-winning combinations  
- **Stack manipulation**: Use moves to break up opponent advantages
- **Tempo control**: Balance offense and defense based on game state

## Winning the Game

### Victory Condition
First player to score **all 4 character types** wins immediately:
- ‚úÖ Ninja (any combination of head + torso + legs)
- ‚úÖ Pirate (any combination of head + torso + legs)  
- ‚úÖ Zombie (any combination of head + torso + legs)
- ‚úÖ Robot (any combination of head + torso + legs)

### Important Notes
- **Immediate win**: Game ends the moment a player scores their 4th character type
- **Multiple copies allowed**: You can score the same character multiple times
- **Move cascade wins**: Victory can occur during move chain reactions

## Game Variants

### Quick Play
- Start with 7 cards instead of 5
- First to 3 different characters wins

### Extended Game  
- First to 2 complete sets (8 characters total) wins
- Adds more strategic depth and longer gameplay

### Draft Mode
- Each player sees 10 cards and drafts 5 alternately
- Play with drafted hands for more strategic control

## Tips for New Players

1. **Learn the wild cards**: Understanding wild card types is crucial for success
2. **Watch opponent stacks**: Always consider defensive plays
3. **Plan your moves**: Think about cascade opportunities before playing
4. **Wild card timing**: Save wilds for turn extension when you need big plays
5. **Stack management**: Don't let stacks get too tall - they become harder to complete

## Common Mistakes

- **Playing too defensively**: Balance blocking with building your own characters
- **Wasting wild cards**: Don't use them for simple plays when regular cards work
- **Ignoring moves**: Always use earned moves - they're powerful and free
- **Poor stack placement**: Organize your stacks to make completions easier to see
- **Turn planning**: Think through the entire turn sequence before playing your first card
